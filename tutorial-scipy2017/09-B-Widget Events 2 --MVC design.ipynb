    "The idea in MVC design is to separate the code for an interactive elements into three separate pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Model**: the model contains the business logic, i.e. the code that carries out whatever actions the GUI is providing access to. Nothing in the model should refer to the code in the view.\n",
    "+ **View**: the view is the on-screen GUI. Here that means the widget code. That code might be simple or it might be complex, depending on the complexity of the interface. \n",
    "+ **Controller**: the controller connects the model to the view. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is typically useful to think through the model first; doing so requires you to think through what inputs you need to calcluate the output you want. Once that is clear it is often straightforward to pick appropriate widgets to use as inputs. The controller just links the two together.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we'll start with the view since the model is pretty straightforward, and we've already been through one round of this."
